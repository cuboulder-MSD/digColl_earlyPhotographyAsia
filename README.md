# Early Photography of Asia

## Description
The Early Photography of Asia Collection consists of original photographs taken in Asia dating from c. 1860-1940 from a variety of collections in the Librariesâ€™ Rare and Distinctive Collections. The images in this collection, though important documentary evidence of life across Asia, are often depicted from a western perspective, since the advent and spread of early photography happened to correspond with the rise of European colonialism in Asia. Europeans often controlled photography infrastructure (its technology, processing, and printing); therefore, most early photography from Asia tends to be made by western governments, colonists, or tourists.
