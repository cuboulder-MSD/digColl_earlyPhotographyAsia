# Early Photography in Asia

## Description
The Early Photography in Asia Collection showcases original photographs taken in Asia dating between 1860 and 1940 from a variety of collections in the Libraries’ Rare and Distinctive Collections. With few exceptions, the images in this collection were taken by people affiliated with the colonial state including Western tourists, colonists, and government officials, who often controlled much of the photography infrastructure in these locations. Therefore, although important documentary evidence of life across Asia, it is important to view these images with a critical eye and consider how these photographs may reinforce orientalist and colonial ideologies and contribute to an “othering” of local people.
