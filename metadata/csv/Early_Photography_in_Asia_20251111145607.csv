It was likely compiled with a mix of studio photographs and original photographs by the French sculptor Claude-Marie Devenet in the 1890s. The images document French colonial city life, the surrounding rivers and river life, Vang Tau, native villages, and colonial French residencies, businesses, and people.","","","","Layout: typically one large photograph per page; occasional pages include 2 or more smaller photographs.","","Photographs: 95 albumen prints. A few of the photographs are numbered or labeled in the negative and eight are described in ink in French. Many of the photographs are city views of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), including the city harbor with the Customs House and headquarters of the Messageries Maritimes, port facilities, French navel ships and river steamers, native Vietnamese boats, the ""dry dock workshops,"" the Grand Canal and Rue Charner, images in the Cholon area (Chinatown), the Governor's Palace, the ""Banque de l'Indochine,"" ""Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Coorporation,"" Mong Bridge, French monuments, French buildings and residences, Notre Dame of Saigon, and industrial facilities. Several photographs show the area around modern Vung Tau. Other photographs are unlabeled but show Vietnamese villages, boats, carts, rickshaws, rice fields, and families.","Photographers: two of the photographs are conclusively tied to Emile Gsell, but it's likely others were taken by Gsell and other studio photographers in Saigon. Other images in the album appear to be originals, perhaps taken by Devenet or other French colonial agents in the late nineteenth century.","The dates of photographs in the album span nearly three decades. The earliest dated photograph is 1870, a Gsell image of a group of Indigenous Vietnamese people. Other identifiable dates include Notre Dame of Saigon before and after completion (completed in 1880), the Governor's Palace (built in 1873) and the Mong Bridge (built in 1893-1894). Therefore, the album was likely compiled around 1895.","The front cover includes the gilt-lettered name of the owner/compiler, ""C.-M. Devenet,"" likely Claude-Marie Devenet, a French sculptor who lived from 1851-1931. Little is known about his life but it seems likely, based on this album, that he could have traveled to or had temporary residence in French colonial Saigon in the 1890s.","Biographical","","","Manners and customs","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1007815","City and town life","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/862081","Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam)--Description and travel--Photographs","local","Vie urbaine","http://data.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb11933752c","","","","","","","","","","","Ho Chi Minh City (Thành Phố Hồ Chí Minh, Viet Nam, Asia) (inhabited place)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7001069","Saigon (Thành Phố Hồ Chí Minh, Viet Nam, Asia) (inhabited place)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7001069","Viet Nam (Asia) (nation)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1000145","","","","","narv_photoEarlyAsia_hoChiMinhCity.pdf","https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:/47540/cj4j1719n489","University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Archives","DS 559.93 S2 D48 1895z","https://libcat.colorado.edu/Record/in00000231155","2025","application/pdf","https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/pdf","reformatted digital","The organization that has made the Item available believes that the Item is in the Public Domain under the laws of the United States, but a determination was not made as to its copyright status under the copyright laws of other countries.

The album was likely compiled and sold by the French photographer Pierre Dieulefils out of his studio in Hanoi, Vietnam during the first decade of the twentieth century for a French colonial audience.","","","","Pierre Dieulefils was a French photographer and postcard publisher based in French Indochina. In 1885 he arrived in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) as a soldier; in 1888 he established a photographic studio in Hanoi. Dieulefils published over 5,000 postcards, primarily of Indochina, between 1902 and the 1920s.","","Layout: album contains seven stiff leaves with photo windows, each with a mounted photograph.","Photographs: the album inludes the following 12 photographs -- ""Pecheurs"" (five fishermen, four of whom are standing in a river with fising implements) -- ""Bac Ninh citadelle"" (the Bac Ninh citadel, occupied by French troops beginning in 1884) -- ""Femme du delta"" (one seated woman with a posed background) -- ""Femme du delta"" (also labeled Femme Tonkinoise, No. 424; one seated woman with a posed background) -- ""Chanteuses"" (a group of seven women in traditional Vietnamese dresses and headgear, as well as two men, one with a dan day) -- "" ... en famille"" (title cut off, a Vietnamese family with three adults and two children) -- ""Pousse Pousse"" (two men operating a rickshaw with another Vietnamese man inside) -- ""Haiphong embarcadere"" (Cam River in Haiphong, with a traditional Vietnamese boat in the foreground and large, French buildings and steamships in the background) -- ""Fabricant de gongs"" (gong makers, two men and two children) -- ""Chasseurs"" (two male hunters with dead birds) -- ""Porteuse d'eau Muong"" (a Muong water carrier) -- ""Mandarin"" (one seated Chinese man in a studio).","Photographer: while none of the photographs are signed and the photographer's name does not appear on the album, at least one of these photographs is definitively taken by Pierre Dieulefils (""Porteuse d'eau Muong""). Based on the subject-matter (northern Vietnam), time period, language, and style, it seems quite likely the whole album was compiled and sold by Dieulefils.","Title from cover.","","Date range is based on the prints and style of the album, although many of the photographs may have been taken earlier.

While the photographs are not in much order, the most likely itinerary is that the group or main photographer left Vancouver, Canada on the RMS Empress of India ship, taking it to Hong Kong. They then spent time in China and Japan before taking the SS Doric ship back to San Francisco, arriving in the United States in April of 1900. Locations in Japan include Tokyo, Yokohama, Miyanoshita Onsen, Sugita, Kobe, Nara, and Kyoto. Locations in China include Hong Kong, Macao, Kowloon, Shanghai, and Canton. Many of the photographs are taken on the RMS Empress of India or the SS Doric ships at sea and include many western people labeled with last names or initials, making it difficult to positively identify anyone.

The photographer traveled to the ruins of Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, and Phnom Penh in Cambodia. They also traveled among indigenous people and villages in Southern and Central Vietnam. They seem to have been based in Ho Chi Minh City (then Saigon) and were part of an early bicycling club there called the ""Groupe du Cercle Cycliste Saigon.""","","","","Layout: a mix of large format photographs with one per page, other photographs arranged two per page, and some smaller photographs arranged four per page.","","Photographs: the album does not appear to be in much order, either thematic or chronologically. It appears to be largely photographs by the compiler, but a few come from studios and are labeled in the negative. It opens with a few photographs of Angkor Wat (two attributed to the photographer Émile Gsell) and a couple of Phnom Penh, Cambodia (a botanical garden and a domesticated elephant). It then includes some photographs of Ho Chi Minh City (then Saigon), including of ships in the harbor and a photograph of a Chinese firefighting crew. A few photographs throughout the album show a ""Groupe du Cercle Cycliste Saigon,"" a group of French men with bicycles that who were part of an early bicycle club in colonial Saigon. The middle of the album includes six images from the arrival from or return to France, including two of the Suez Canal, two of Colombo (Sri Lanka) and two of Singapore. A next set of smaller images document a trip to the Central Vietnam Highlands, including photographs of indigenous groups such as the Cham, Mai (Ma), and some termed Moi (an umbrella term for Montagnards). Places visited by the photographer include: Nha Trang, Khanh-Hoa, Rach Gia, and Binh Thuan, as well as some locations that are difficult to find the modern equivalent (such as Ya Lam and Tan Linh). The album ends with many images of Angkor ruins, particularly those of Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom. There are also six loose, mounted photographs tucked into the album, but they are all duplicates of images also found in the album. These photographs were perhaps displayed separately at one time.","Photographer: the photographer is never named or identified in the album. They were likely a French traveler or colonial agent in French Indochina. They seem to have traveled fairly extensively from Ho Chi Minh City (then Saigon) to Phnom Penh and Angkor ruins in Cambodia as well as a variety of locations in Southern and Central Vietnam. The album also includes a couple images from their arrival or return trip through the Suez Canal, Sri Lanka, and Singapore.","Date: only one of the images is dated, the inauguration of the velodrome in Saigon, Oct. 2, 1897. It seems likely that the rest of the original photographs were taken in 1897 or the years just around that, and that the album was compiled in the late 1890s. A few of the studio photographs, particularly those of Émile Gsell, may have been taken as early as the 1860s, but his prints were sold out of photo studios for decades.","","","","","Indigenous peoples--Vietnam--Photographs","local","Cyclists--Vietnam--Ho Chi Minh City--Photographs--1890s","local","Vietnam, Central--Description and travel--Photographs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Viet Nam (Asia) (nation)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1000145","Khmer (Asia) (Empire) (former nation/state/empire)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/8711777","Angkor (Extinct city)","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh91005312","Cambodia (Asia) (nation)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1000109","","","narv_photogEarlyAsia_vietnamAndCambodia.pdf","https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:/47540/ws5m1b4700nw","University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Archives","DS556.36 .P461 1897","https://libcat.colorado.edu/Record/in00000457777","2025","application/pdf","https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/pdf","reformatted digital","The organization that has made the Item available believes that the Item is in the Public Domain under the laws of the United States, but a determination was not made as to its copyright status under the copyright laws of other countries.

The images are a mix of studio and original photographs of a variety of cities, towns, and people in Northern Vietnam.","","","","Photographs: 68 albumen, collodion silver printing-out paper, and silver gelatin prints of Northern Vietnam. About half of the images are studio photographs labeled and numbered in the negative and many of these seem to have come from the studio of Pierre Dieulefils, a French photographer based in Hanoi. The other half of the photographs seem to be originals taken by the owner or another amateur photographer and are unlabeled but appear to be in the Hanoi and Northern Vietnam region. The images generally depict a variety of cities, local peoples, and French colonists and colonial buildings. The labeled locations of the photographs include Hanoi in particular, but also Viet Tri, Haiphong, Lang Son, Do Son, Bat Bac, Bao Ha, Lao Cai, My Tho, Ban Thi, Song Da near Cho Bo, and Ha Long Bay. One photograph is labeled ""Famille de Koat, chef pirate soumis."" Unlabeled photographs show Angkor Wat, city streets, a variety of villages, boats, carts, a railway bridge, and water buffaloes.","","Date range is based on when Pierre Dieulefils opened his shop in Hanoi, since many of the studio photographs were likely purchased there. The album was probably compiled in the 1890s, since it is a mix of photographic types (albumen prints, collodion silver printing-out paper, and gelatin silver prints).","","","","","","","Vietnam, Northern--Description and travel--Photographs","local","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hà Nội (Thành Phố Hà Nội, Viet Nam, Asia) (inhabited place)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7001070","North Vietnam (Viet Nam, Asia) (territory)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/6004319","","","","","","","narv_photogEarlyAsia_nVietnamAndHanoi.pdf","https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:/47540/0v575f64v5xz","University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Archives","DS559.92.T6 P46 1888z","https://libcat.colorado.edu/Record/in00000075122","2025","application/pdf","https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/pdf","reformatted digital","The organization that has made the Item available believes that the Item is in the Public Domain under the laws of the United States, but a determination was not made as to its copyright status under the copyright laws of other countries.
